FFmpeg is a complete solution to record, convert and stream audio
and video. It includes libavcodec, the leading audio/video codec
library. This builds from git directly.

This builds the git snapshot of ffmpeg
The last opencv ffmpeg supports is version 3.4.x and is an
optional dependency.python3-numpy and OpenBLAS is only needed
if you want to install opencv or lv2 plugins.

add these to bashrc
export PATH=/opt/ffmpeg/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/ffmpeg/lib64:/usr/lib64:/usr/lib64/zulu-openjdk17/lib/server"
