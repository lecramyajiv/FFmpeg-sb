libbluray,libcaca,libxml2 not compiling statically with ffmpeg



 To allow libvdpau to find libvdpau-va-gl, set an environment variable. As the root user:

echo "export VDPAU_DRIVER=va_gl" >> /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh

libmfx is depreceated
vdpau won't build static libs

for rtmp: libgmp
for SSL: libressl
hardware accel: opencl and libvpl
choose ladspa lv2 needs openblas and python3-numpy

consider removeing /opt/bin/bzegrep -> /tmp/SBo/dep/usr/bin/bzgrep
package contains symlinks outside the package (which is OK, if intentional):
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 27 Jan 21 23:03 ./opt/bin/bzegrep -> /tmp/SBo/dep/usr/bin/bzgrep
OK



Please note that the default VMAF model
("/usr/local/share/model/vmaf_v0.6.1.json")
will be used unless you set the following flag when running the encoder:

~~~
    # --vmaf-model-path=path/to/model
